DESCRIPTION
       Tk::LCD is a Canvas derived widget, based on a code snip-
       pet from Donal K. Fellows' Maze game. LCD symbols are dis-
       played in elements composed of 8 segments, labeled "a"
       though "g", some on and some off.  For instance, the num-
       ber 8 requires one LCD element that has all 8 segments
       lit:

            b

            -
        a  | | c
            -      <------  g
        f  | | d
            _

            e

       A Tk::LCD widget can consist of any number of elements,
       specified during widget creation.  To actually display an
       LCD number, either invoke the set() method, or use the
       -variable option.
